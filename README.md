Loan Classification Project 

Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved. It uses applicant details and financial data to streamline the loan approval process and provide data-driven insights for financial institutions. 

Dataset Summary 
The dataset includes features describing applicant demographics, financial details, and loan-specific attributes.

Key Features:
-  loan_id: Unique identifier for each application.
-  no_of_dependents: Number of dependents supported by the applicant.
-  education: Applicant's educational qualification (e.g., graduate).
-  self_employed: Indicates if the applicant is self-employed (Yes/No).
-  income_annum: Applicantâ€™s annual income.
-  loan_amount: Requested loan amount.
-  loan_term: Loan repayment period (in years).
-  cibil_score: Applicant's credit score.
-  residential_assets_value: Value of residential properties owned.
-  commercial_assets_value: Value of commercial properties owned.
-  luxury_assets_value: Value of luxury assets (e.g., cars, jewellery).
-  bank_asset_value: Bank-held asset values (e.g., savings).
-  loan_status: Loan approval status (target variable).

Methodology  
1.Preprocessing: 
- One-hot encoded categorical variables like education and self_employed. Label Encoded the target variable Loan Status.
- Scaled numerical features like income amount, residential assets values, Cibil(credit) score, etc. 
- Split the Dataset into training and test sets, with the training set being 80 percent of the dataset. 

2.Modelling: 
- Evaluated multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector, and Random Forest.
- Conducted hyperparamter tuning using GridSearchCV. 


3.Evaluation:
- Metrics used: Accuracy, F1=Score, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix. 

- Results 
Best Model: Random Forest Classifier.
Performance Metrics: 
	Accuracy: 98.01%
	F1-Score(Approved): 0.9842
	F1-Score(Not Approved): 0.9731
	Precision(Approved): 0.9888
	Precision(Not Approved): 0.9654
	Recall(Approved): 0.9797
	Recall(Not Approved): 0.9808

Key Insights 
- Credit score is the strongest predictor of loan approval.
- Income level also positively influences the likelihood of loan approval.
- Surprisingly, education level had no significant impact on loan approval outcomes.
	
Conclusion 
This project highlights how machine learning can efficiently predict loan approvals and provide actionable insights for financial decision-making.
